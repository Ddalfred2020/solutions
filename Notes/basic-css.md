# Meaning of css
css stands for cascading style sheet, it is used to change the look and feel of a website
let create a button element in html
`<button>send</button>`
to style this element we will add a **class** attribute to the button
`<button class="bigbutton">send</button>`
to target this class in code we will have to declare a **style** element
`<style></style>` within this style element a css code is written
```
.bigbutton{
background-color:red;
color:blue;
border:none;
}
```
this code changes the background color,text color and border of the button respectively.
