# Flex-Box

Flex-box are similar to grid but are more flexible hence the name flex-box or flexible box
to create a flex-box we have to execute the following steps  
```
display flex for the display property
flex-direction to tell the flex to  be horizontal, row or vertical, column
we can use justify-content to position the elements either start, middle or end.
and align-item to position the items around top,bottom,left or right.
```
1fr in grid is the same as the flex:1 property, we can use flex to design the header element and the navigation bar depending on the circumstances.
