# Position

In css the position property is use to place one item on top of another to make the header bar stay fixed to a particular position as well as the navigation bar.
we have position static and position fixed. position static is like no position at all while position fixed make the position stay at a paticular position. we use the position property to indicate this
```
position: fixed;
top:10px; how far from the top
bottom
right
left
when opposite position is set it stretches to cover the space
eg top:10px;
bottom:10px;
```
